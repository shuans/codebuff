/**
 * Test script to verify Fireworks AI prompt caching across a 10-turn conversation.
 *
 * Uses a very large system prompt (~5k+ input tokens) with low output (max 100 tokens)
 * to measure how well Fireworks caches the shared prefix across turns.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/test-fireworks-long.ts [model] [--deployment]
 *
 * Models:
 *   glm-5.1   (default) — z-ai/glm-5.1
 *   minimax             — minimax/minimax-m2.5
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --deployment   Use custom deployment instead of serverless (standard API)
 *                  Serverless is the default
